FAQ:

1) WHY

  Because many of the other solutions didn't do what we wanted, or 
anything even approximating what we needed.  Transient events are 
hard to catch, and if you are lucky they are logged.  If you aren't
lucky, you have a hung machine with very little data.  Triggers are 
a very important aspect of this, and we plan to implement them very
shortly.

If you have several tens of machines, or tens of thousands of 
machines with differing OSes, it would be awful nice if you had a 
way to do more than run a client on the machine in question, especially 
if that client crashed with the OS ...  

Think top of rack monitoring for cloud scale deployments (among other
things) where you have to decide whether or not a node needed service,
or a swift kick in the power cord.


2) WHY NOT USE X (X being some package that does some part of the above)

  Good question.  See above answer as to why.  If X depends upon other 
subsystems being up, you have a problem when something below that
crashes and takes out your logging and alerting solution.

  Things like Zabbix et al are great tools, until something crashes and
the agent becomes unresponsive.  They can tell you that it became
unresponsive.  We should be able to tell you why.


3) GEE ... IS THIS GENERAL ENOUGH YOU CAN USE IT FOR THINGS OTHER 
THAN LINUX?

 Why ... yes, yes you can.  We will be using this with SmartOS as well
as Linux.  And if we (or someone) can help us understand how to do this 
with (insert your favorite OS here), you can bet we will ask them to write
up how to do this, or allow us to, in order to share.


4) WHY IN ALL THAT IS HOLY DID YOU WRITE THIS IN PERL???!?!?!?! DONT 
YOU KNOW LANGUAGE Q IS INFINITELY BETTER???  ISNT PERL LINE NOISE???

  Um ... yeah.  Ok.  <bitbucket /> .


5) WE NEED FEATURE Z, PLEASE WRITE IT AND SUPPORT IT FOR US

  Sure thing, contact our info@scalableinformatics.com and ask for a 
quote

   NO, FOR FREE

  Um ... yeah ... righto ... sure thing.  <bitbucket />


6) WE NEED FEATURE Z, WE WILL WRITE IT AND SUPPORT IT  

  Cool!  Let me know once it is done and we will review it.
